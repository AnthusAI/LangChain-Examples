        "# Pydantic Output Parser\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to use LangChain and Pydantic to parse a dataset of recipes and extract structured information, specifically the number of avocados required for each recipe. The goal is to find recipes that can be made with just one avocado, simulating a scenario where someone has limited ingredients and wants to explore their cooking options.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code uses an LLM to process unstructured recipe text, extracting key details like title, ingredients, directions, and the avocado count. It filters the dataset for recipes containing avocados, processes a small sample, and outputs structured information for recipes requiring one avocado or less. The Pydantic model ensures type consistency, particularly for the numeric avocado count, while LangChain manages the interaction with the LLM and structures the output."

Do not put too many pieces into the pan at once. Only cook a few at a time. While the batter is still thick on the fish and dripping, drop it into the oil and fry it about 4-5 minutes, turning to the other side about halfway through.\n",
            "- To serve: Serve with steamed tortillas. You can serve with the sauce, cabbage, lime and avocado as suggested above (put fish into taco, add avocado, cabbage, top with sauce and a squeeze of lime). Or lately we just serve with Spicy Chipotle Slaw inside the tortilla with the fish. Usually two pieces of fish per taco.\n",
